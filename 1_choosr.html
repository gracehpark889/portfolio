                                   My team and I first thought of the idea of Choosr when discussing some painpoints we encounter day-to-day. The difficulty of finding a place to go/eat when out with friends was a commonality we found and from there we wanted to dive in deeper. Before we got started, we wanted to see for ourselves the studies done on the concept of decision making.<br> <br><b>Here's what we found:</b> <br><br>
                                   <div class="statscontainer">

                                   • Based on a study from the University of Minnesota, too many choices can cause individuals to feel overwhelmed, hoard their energy, and are more likely to procrastinate on their decisions. This can lead to <b>"decision fatigue"</b> and can ultimately make individuals less likely to come to a conclusive decision at all.<br><br>
                                   • The theory of <b>"groupthink"</b> states that it is more difficult to make a decision when in groups than alone. In order to keep the peace, people are more prone to suppressing their opinions in order to maintain group harmony. <br><br>
                                   • The idea of the <b>"herd mentality"</b> states that individuals often end up copying decisions instead of making one's own, causing one to ignore their own instincts.

                            To gain a better understanding of the problem at hand, five <span class="highlight">user interviews</span> were planned and conducted regarding pain points and future opportunities. Participants were asked to share about their experience when collectively making decisions of where to go when out with friends.

                                <b>• 43.5%</b> of participants stated that it takes around 20-40 minutes when coming up with a group consensus. <br>
                                <b>• 55.5%</b> of participants leaned more towards being decisive as a person.<br><br>
                            
                                Overall, it was interesting to learn that some of our initial hypotheses differed from the results. For instance, we hypothesized that individuals would naturally be indecisive as people but we later found out that our hypothesis was incorrect.

We took away the classic on-boarding process by allowing users to go straight to the main purpose of the app. Our user flow was built to ensure intuitive actions and straight forward accessibility.

                                    The second feedback was that users felt it was a <span class="highlight">bit tedious to continually click on the back button in order to return to the home screen.</span> We fixed this problem by adding a simple "Home" button to the top right of the screen for users to easily return to the initial page.

Playful colors and modern text were incorporated to allow the process of using the app simple and fun. We inferred that users would most likely be viewing Choosr with others which is why we made sure the buttons took up the full width of the screen as well as enlarging text.

                            <li> <b> User Research is a must </b><br> User research is the foundation of any design process. I learned that you must constantly be thinking about the user in every step of the way, understanding who you're designing for as well as why is crucial to bring your designs to life. </li><br>

                            <li> <b>Iterate, iterate, iterate </b><br> We had to go through a good amount of iterations before pushing out our final prototype. What we thought was a straight forward application was not so simplistic as we envisioned. There were many times where we would test our prototypes and would find participants confused and stuck on a user flow. I learned that iterations are vital in creating a design that can be universally understood by all.  </li><br>
                        
                        </ol>
                    Overall, Choosr taught me how to apply conceptual thinking into real life designs. From thinking about the problem, to working towards creating a solution, I was able to learn how each step must have purpose in order to reach the end goal. <br>
